# CSV-Trained EfficientNet B5 Inference Configuration
# Using the model trained on CSV dataset with 5 classes
model:
  name: "efficientnet" # Or densenet, resnet, yolov11
  variant: "b5" # Model variant 
  weights_path: "path/to/your/model/weights"
  num_classes: 5  # Number of classes 

inference:
  image_dir: "path/to/your/inference/images" # Directory containing images for inference
  batch_size: 64 # Batch size for inference, your might need to adjust this based on your GPU memory
  top_k: 5 # Number of top predictions to return
  device: "cuda" # Device to run inference on, options: "cuda", "cpu", "auto"
  save_csv: true # Save results to CSV
  output_path: "outputs/saved_results.csv" # Path to save the inference results CSV

# Optional preprocessing during inference
preprocessing:
  scalebar_removal: true # If you want to remove scalebars before inference, set this to true, e.g if your images contain scalebars
  
wandb:
  log_results: false  # Whether or not you want to log results to Weights & Biases
  tags: ["inference", "csv_dataset"]
  notes: "Inference with custom model (5 classes)"
