# 🎯 YOLOv11 Training Configuration - BEGINNER FRIENDLY
# ============================================================

# 📖 WHAT IS YOLOv11?
# YOLOv11 is a modern, fast, and accurate neural network originally designed for object detection
# but also works very well for image classification (like identifying plankton species).
# It's often faster than EfficientNet while maintaining good accuracy.

# 🏷️ TRAINING RUN IDENTIFICATION
run_name: "YOLOv11_Default_Training_Run"  # Name to identify this training session

# 📂 DATA CONFIGURATION
data:
  # ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Point this to your final preprocessed dataset
  # Should contain train/, val/, test/ folders and a dataset.yaml file
  dataset_path: "DATA/sample_hierarchical_final_dataset"  

# 📊 PROJECT TRACKING (Weights & Biases)
project:
  name: "YourWandBProjectName"     # Your experiment tracking project name

# 🤖 MODEL CONFIGURATION
model:
  name: "yolov11"           # 🎯 Use YOLOv11 architecture
                            # YOLOv11 is modern, fast, and accurate for classification
                            # Excellent choice for real-time applications
  variant: "Default-cls"   
                            
  pretrained: true          # 🔥 Start with pre-trained weights (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
                            # true = much faster training and better results
                            # false = train from scratch (not recommended for beginners)
                            
  freeze_backbone: false    # 🧊 Whether to freeze feature extraction layers
                            # false = train entire model (RECOMMENDED)
                            # true = only train final classification layer
                            
  input_size: 224           # 📐 Input image size (224x224 pixels)
                            # All images will be resized to this size
                            
  num_classes: 76           # 📊 Number of species/classes in your dataset
                            # MUST match the number of classes in your data

# 📊 TRAINING BEHAVIOR
# YOLOv11 has built-in smart training settings, so we don't need to configure
# learning rates, optimizers, etc. manually - it handles this automatically!

# 📈 WEIGHTS & BIASES CONFIGURATION (Experiment Tracking)
wandb:
  log_results: true         # 📊 Upload training progress to Weights & Biases
                            # true = see charts and progress online (recommended)
                            # false = save results locally only

  notes: "YOLOv11 training with default settings - great for beginners!"  # 📝 Experiment description

# 💡 YOLO ADVANTAGES FOR BEGINNERS:
# ✅ Automatic hyperparameter tuning - no need to guess learning rates!
# ✅ Built-in data augmentation - improves model robustness
# ✅ Fast training and inference - good for quick experiments
# ✅ Excellent accuracy - often matches or beats other architectures
# ✅ Simple configuration - fewer parameters to worry about

# 🚀 GETTING STARTED:
# 1. Make sure your dataset_path points to your preprocessed data
# 2. Set num_classes to match your actual number of species
# 3. Run: python3 run_training.py --config configs/training/TrainDefaultYolo.yaml
# 4. Watch the training progress in your terminal or on Weights & Biases!
