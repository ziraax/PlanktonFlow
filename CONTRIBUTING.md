💡 Notes
- This project currently does not enforce automated tests or CI checks — please test your changes locally before submitting.
-  If you’re unsure about an idea, feel free to open an issue first to discuss it before writing code.
- Be kind and respectful in all interactions — this is my first "big" project, so code quality may vary across the codebase. Contributions that improve clarity, consistency, and structure are very welcome.
